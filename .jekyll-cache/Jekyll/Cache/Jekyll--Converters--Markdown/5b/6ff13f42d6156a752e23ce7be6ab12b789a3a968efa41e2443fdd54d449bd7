<p>Yann LeCun described GANs as ‚Äúthe most interesting idea in the last 10 years in Machine Learning‚Äù. And, indeed, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs for short) have had a huge success since they were introduced in 2014 by Ian J. Goodfellow.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>This project will involve learning many machine learning algorithms leading to GANs. Mentees will implement a Generative Adversarial Network from scratch.

<p>For students who have participated in Summer of Science (Machine Learning track) before, this would be a great hands-on project!</p>
