We will be implementing rampart algorithm, for the prevention of denial of service attack. We will begin with socket programming in C++  and implement pop3 algorithm for email access. In case it gets completed real soon and easily, we will try to implement rampart in c++. 

<!--break-->

Prerequisites : Efficiency in c++, slight knowledge of networks and socket programming will help. May have to read a lot of theory so be prepared for that.

<!--break-->

Mentor will conduct an interview for the selection of mentees.

## Timeline:
- Implement pop3 in 4 weeks 
- Then switch to Rampart
