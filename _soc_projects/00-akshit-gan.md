Yann LeCun described GANs as “the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in Machine Learning”. And, indeed, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs for short) have had a huge success since they were introduced in 2014 by Ian J. Goodfellow.

This project will involve learning many machine learning algorithms leading to GANs. Mentees will implement a Generative Adversarial Network from scratch.

For students who have participated in Summer of Science (Machine Learning track) before, this would be a great hands-on project!

### Tentative Timeline:

- Learn/Brush-up Python, Torch, Jupyter, Numpy, Unix commands
- Learn Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks
- Read up on the use cases and building blocks of Deep Learning.
- Implement a generative adversarial network from scratch and train it on toy dataset.
- Learn PyTorch/TensorFlow, implement a GAN network using the library.
- Start collecting data and training.
- Document all interesting observations
